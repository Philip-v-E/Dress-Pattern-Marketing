Task:

1. Silhouette & Structure:
   For 2026, modernize the classic A-line silhouette seen here by incorporating structured sculptural panels that create a subtle, shell-like asymmetry on one side of the skirt, echoing the garment’s circular motifs. Add a sharply contoured, single-shoulder neckline with an integrated draped cowl on the opposite collarbone for dynamic, directional appeal. Employ modular side vents at the base of the skirt with concealed closures to permit movement and reveal contrasting silk insets printed with refracted Kente motifs.

2. Hardware & Detailing:
   Integrate seamless, biodegradable zippers along the side seams for invisible closure and reduce bulk. Add hand-embroidered micro-beading along selected spiral motifs for textural contrast and subtle shimmer, using recycled glass beads sourced locally for cultural authenticity. Incorporate laser-cut silk appliqué motifs echoing Ankara heritage, layered along the hem and neckline for tactile depth, and finish all internal seams with French binding to ensure Swiss-grade durability.

3. Designer Instructions:
   - Engineer asymmetrical, structured skirt panels with concealed modular vents and underlay in contrast technical silk, ensuring both drama and wearability.
   - Embroider spiral patterns with eco-friendly, locally sourced micro-beads at strategic points for a luxurious, tactile experience.
   - Laser-cut and appliqué modernized Ankara shapes around neckline and skirt hem in tonal layering using technical silk remnants, reinforcing the zero-waste design ethos.
