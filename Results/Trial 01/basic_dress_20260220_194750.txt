**Task:**

**1. Silhouette & Structure:**  
Modernize the classic A-line sleeveless maxi dress by introducing an asymmetric, sculpted neckline that gracefully transitions into a softly draped single-shoulder capelet, referencing Ghanaian cultural regalia. Fuse architectural pleating with precision-cut technical silk panels along one side for dimensionality, and insert a subtle, angular high-low hem to showcase layered volume and movement—echoing Afro-futurist sensibilities. The bodice should offer a tailored, corset-inspired structure using Swiss precision cotton, while the skirt maintains fluidity with lightweight, zero-waste engineered panels.

**2. Hardware & Detailing:**  
Integrate seamless, concealed magnetic zips at the side for ease and minimal visual disturbance. Use bio-based, laser-etched “Kente blockchain” buttons at the waist or shoulder as both a closure and digital provenance marker. Subtly apply embroidered metallic thread tracing Ghanaian Adinkra symbols in between the bold blue florals, infusing an avant-garde, heritage-driven layer. Contrast raw-edge silk appliqués atop the floral motifs for tactile dimension, and stitch in recycled silk micro-linings for softness and breathability.

**3. Specific Designer Instructions:**  
1. Rescale the blue floral print into modular motifs inspired by both Swiss geometric symmetry and stylized West African Ankara patterns, digitally engineered for zero textile waste during cutting.  
2. Construct the left shoulder as a structured, extended silhouette using bonded silk, while the opposite side softly drapes with a semi-sheer technical silk capelet adorned in metallic Adinkra embroidery.  
3. Use only monomaterial (100% cotton or silk) or detachable trims to ensure every garment component is fully recyclable or biodegradable, aligning with strict circular fashion principles.
